  1. If a circuit is connected like Figure 5-1 on page 167 for our textbook, you need to program to implement brightness-level control through PWM. This is achieved by flashing 
  the LED faster than can be perceived by a human, where the amount of time that the LED remains on, versus off(i.e., the duty cycle) affects 
  the human-perceived bright-ness level. You need to provide a menu for users' selection as Listing 5-3 did on page 174. With setup command, the delay time and the close time 
  need to be set. The delay time is used for the time before an LED's brightness begins to change; the close time is the time for the brightness is changed 
  from maximum to minimum.
